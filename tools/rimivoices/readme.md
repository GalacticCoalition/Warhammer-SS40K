# RimiVoices V1
###### Look man, names are hard.

Welcome to the shitshow that is RimiVoices, a small project by me to automatically generate passable vox and announcer voicelines with minimal effort.

Most important notes are stuffed into the python files at their relevant locations, with general notes being in this readme.

Powered by [Python 3.6+](https://python.org), [OpenTTS](https://github.com/synesthesiam/opentts) [zh-2.1](https://hub.docker.com/r/synesthesiam/opentts) <sup>(< separate links!)</sup>, and [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org) 2.4, for a truly cross-platform solution.

Also partially made out of spite CAUSE NO ONE DOCUMENTS HOW THE FUCK THEY MADE THEIR VOICES, HOLY FUCKING SHIT GUYS, HOW DO YOU GUYS EXPECT US TO NOT STAGNATE ON VOICELINES IF IT'S NOT FUCKING DOCUMENTED?!?!?!

Basic understanding of python and audacity's [macro script](https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/scripting_reference.html) system is **required** to leverage this system properly.

Librosa is required for the python scripts (`pip install librosa`).

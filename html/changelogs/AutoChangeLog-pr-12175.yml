  - imageadd: "SPLIT THE MASTER UNIFORM FILE TO HAVE A SECURITY SUBTYPE. ONLY SECURITY UNIFORMS SHOULD BE IN HERE. EXPECT THIS TO EXPAND ONTO OTHER DEPARTMENTS AS WELL. (TG already does this, its much easier to maintain than one giant file.)"
  - imagedel: "Removed lots of unused Security icons. (Literally, these had no items. Ingame you'll see no change from this.)"

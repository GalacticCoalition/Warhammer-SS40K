  - rscadd: "You may now pick Implant as a preferred uplink location, meaning
that if you become a traitor, you will start with an uplink implant. The
cost of the implant (4 TC) is deducted from your total starting TC,
because the Syndicate doesn't give freebies."
  - bugfix: "Admins removing an uplink from a person with an uplink implant will
now destroy the implant, rather than leaving an implant that does
nothing."

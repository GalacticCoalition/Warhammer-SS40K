  - rscadd: "Announcements now play for the romerol/battlecruiser summons at time of use."
  - balance: "Final objectives to summon romerol/the battlecruiser now require significantly more actual objective completion. Additionally, calling the battlecruiser now waits on a 3-5 min. timer before actually starting the spawns."

changes: 
  - bugfix: "Wrapping a bounty cube then unwrapping it no longer scams the owner out of a cut"
  - bugfix: "Wrapping a bounty cube then applying a barcode no longer grants a bigger cut than deserved, or steals money from the original owner"
  - bugfix: "The internal radio within bounty cubes is no longer exported. Every bounty cube sold gave cargo an extra FOUR credits. How much extra money was gained by radios alone?"
  - refactor: "Refactored Pricetag component, less getcomponent and ugly signals, more sanity, harder to break"

changes:
  - rscadd: "Added an option to polarize windows, so that they can be toggled between tinted and clear at will in-round. To do so, simply slap a capacitor on any kind of window, except windoors."
  - rscadd: "To control the polarized windows, you can use a window polarization remote controller, which can be printed from any autolathe and from engineering techfabs at roundstart. Use it in-hand to set its channel ID, and then slap it against windows with polarization controllers installed to link them to it. Place it in a button, or put it together with other assemblies, in order to have a way to activate it, and toggle all connected windows at once."
  - rscadd: "Added support for mappers to create polarized windows with custom IDs, look at https://github.com/Skyrat-SS13/Skyrat-tg/pull/19907 for more details on how to use them."

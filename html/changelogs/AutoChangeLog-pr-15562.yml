  - balance: "Major borer rebalance. Borer abilities now generally cause brain damage up to and including traumas. Borers can no longer heal brain damage/traumas on their own. Borers require living hosts to gain stats, chems, or heal. Hosts must manage more significant costs even with passive borers. Borer objectives are now much more realistically achievable, and willing hosts contribute to much greater boosts for borers than unwilling hosts. Borer actionspeed/movespeed buffs reduced. Borers have stamina damage and confusion on their Fear ability as well as the ability to make Multiver (a chem purger) and Mindbreaker Toxin (a hallucinogen that can be used to brainwash/incapacitate) without learning from prior samples."

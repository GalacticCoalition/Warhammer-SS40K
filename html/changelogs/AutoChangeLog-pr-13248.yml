  - spellcheck: "Pan Slavic description changed to match the lore.
tweak: Replaced \"Selenian\" with \"Sol Common\", use \",sol\" to speak. The directory is the same, so you don't need to re-select it."
  - spellcheck: "Dwarf no longer has an odd chance to drop a syllable with a percentage symbol in it."
  - imageadd: "Sol Common language icon, replaced red star with proposed NRI flag (thanks Russian community), gave the Skrell icon a little uplifting"

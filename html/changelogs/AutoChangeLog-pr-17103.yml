changes: 
  - qol: "Crafting benches now take their resources from the tiles surrounding, rather than having to put them into the bench."
  - qol: "The crafting bench UI is now a radial menu, and there are now several improved examines for see what ingredients or steps a recipe needs."
  - bugfix: "All of the materials of the components for crafting things (forged components that is, not using wood) will be added to the weapon, rather than just the materials of the last item used, which means no more material deletion."
  - refactor: "Crafting bench code has been changed to use datums rather than a hardcoded list of recipes"

changes: 
  - rscadd: "Added the NMC Phoenix, NMC Chimera, NMC Drudge, and NMC Manticore 'advanced shuttles' as new mining/labor shuttles"
  - rscadd: "The NLV Consign (Cargo shuttle) has been retrofitted to match up to this standard, and returned to use aboard the station. Though, their manual piloting was, ah, damaged, and will not return."
  - balance: "You can no longer hide in wall lockers. Sorry, but, uh, 'what? how?'. Small animals still fit, however."
  - balance: "The NTV Relay (Arrivals shuttle) no longer starts with higher quality internals tanks than engineering, nor a seclite."
  - bugfix: "The NAV Monarch (CC Ferry), NTV Relay, and evac shuttle now have floortiles that all match up with eachother. No more random uneven floors!"
  - bugfix: "The NAV Monarch now aligns with the CC dock, so both doors are usable."
  - bugfix: "Wall closets can no longer fit humans. How it was possible, not even science can answer, but the demons that allowed it have been dispelled."
  - bugfix: "Rockplanet now uses the correct landing dock ID for the public shuttle"

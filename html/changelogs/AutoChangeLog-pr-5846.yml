  - bugfix: "Freezers should be able to hit the target temperature without hovering above it like it used to on mixes with less heat capacity. Motor heat doubled and only affects the heat reservoir side. 5 Kelvin wiggle room for motor heat from previous' 1.5."
  - rscdel: "Thermomachines can't pump gases into the reservoir port anymore."

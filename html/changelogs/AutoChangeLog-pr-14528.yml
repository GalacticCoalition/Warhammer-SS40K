changes: 
  - code_imp: "The screenshot tests have been improved, giving us more flexibility to make species look exactly the way we want them to, in a consistent manner."
  - bugfix: "A handful of species now look a lot more appropriate in the prefs menu, at long last! That's a few less neon-green alien-looking monstrosities to look at!"
  - bugfix: "All antagonist roles will now look the way they're intended to look, in the \"Antagonist\" tab of the prefs menu."
  - bugfix: "The MODsuit armor booster module should now look the way it's intended to look on Clown-branded Syndicate MODsuits."
  - bugfix: "Moths have had their greyscale bodyparts updated to be properly greyscaled, allowing for much more precise coloring."
  - bugfix: "Outfits will no longer call pre_equip() and post_equip() twice when they're being equiped, which previously resulted in certain clothes acting all funky."

  - bugfix: "The CIN replicator medipen pouch and pocket first-aid kit no longer have bag-like functionality (scooping/the action button), which they didn't need to fit in your pockets anyway."
  - balance: "First-aid pouches (the ones through Cargo for 300 cr) now have five slots; one up from four."
  - rscadd: "Ammo pouches can now be reskinned into casing pouches, which let them hold ten individual shell casings in your pocket. Yes, this includes shotgun shells. This is also primarily intended for shotgun users."

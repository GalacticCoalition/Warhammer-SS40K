You shouldn't display much intelligence if any. This also means if you're engaging in combat you should refrain from mercing people fully. Play not to win but to create a challenge. You're there to replace AI, make others enjoy the situation as well. If your simple mob is not above simple or mute intelligence, using structures such as welding tanks/canisters/boxes to hinder your opponent is entirely forbidden. Do not do this."

  - imageadd: "The NRI surplus armor is getting a pretty big resprite and reflavoring, ordering surplus armor in the surplus crates might give you a bunch of mismatched colors you know!"
  - rscadd: "Izlishek Company Military Supplier has stopped selling the old NRI armor vests, in exchange for selling tactical floor tile grey variations of the new CIN armor and uniform set"
  - balance: "This does, technically, mean a balance change. For the bit of lore behind the armor, and the actual armor values to line up, and for the vests to not just be \"sec vests but better in every way\", they've lost a majority of their (barely existent) energy and laser protection, in exchange for a little extra bomb and wound armor."

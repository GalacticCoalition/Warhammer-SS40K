  - qol: "the Corset uniform is now instead an Underwear option! Now you can actually wear it under the clothes of your choice!"
  - imagedel: "Removed the Stripper uniforms (They're all underwear types(Even the Mankini, on TG even)); the bunny ones have remained"
  - imageadd: "after WAY too long sitting on the backburner, the generic Utility Uniform is now up-to-par with the departmental variants. The classic prisoner uniform has also been slightly touched up."
  - imageadd: "Resorted a few less important items, and the base jumpsuits themselves, into different icon files. Keep an eye out for sprite bugs! If you see one, make a bug report on github, and ping @OrionTheFox!"

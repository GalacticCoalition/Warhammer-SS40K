2021-11-03:
  Guillaume Prata:
  - balance: Plasmamen belt tanks volume and the rate that their lungs consume plasma
      got lowered to 1/4 to stop the easy 2 hour long O2 inside a plasmamen belt tank
      trick. It doesn't change how long the internals last for plasmamen.
  Kryson:
  - balance: Regular medical syringe guns have been replaced with syringe rifles
  - imageadd: new dna/dart/medical Syringe gun sprite
  RatFromTheJungle:
  - bugfix: fixes the guard baton being deleted because you brought your wintercoat
      to work.
  Ryll/Shaps:
  - rscadd: Added shaking soda cans! Take an unopened soda can and right click it
      in hand to shake it all around, increasing its fizziness.
  - balance: Having an unopened soda can hucked at you will actually hurt quite a
      bit, around the level of a toolbox. This also has a chance of bursting the soda
      can on impact, leaving it useless as a weapon after.
  SkyratBot:
  - balance: brain washing now cures up to lobotomy tier traumas
  - rscadd: You can now disarm someone into an available open locker to close it on
      them as your disarming action.

      Again.
  - balance: Obsessed have a low chance of stuttering and displaying shifty behavior
      near their targets, instead of vomiting or passing out if on good mood. This
      is to better allow verbal interactions between obsessed and obsession target,
      while keeping them shifty and creepy.
  - spellcheck: corrected the name of the peripherals control board being secured
      on the Savannah-Ivanov
  - balance: Radiation is now a status effect, where you are either irradiated or
      not. When irradiated, you will take constant toxin damage, and irregular burn
      damage. Radiation is removed once all toxin damage is healed. Standing under
      a shower will pause the harmful effects of radiation, making it easier to heal.
      Everything that is irradiated will glow green.
  - balance: A lot of radiation sources keep their radiating capabilities, though
      most of it was eyeballed. If anything was significantly nerfed/buffed, feel
      free to let me know.
  - rscdel: Removes contamination from radiation.
  - balance: Uranium structures will irradiate those around them, but will be delayed,
      giving you time to stay away.
  - rscdel: The radioactive microlaser no longer irradiates, but still has its knockdown,
      which was never related.
  - balance: Seiver now heals high toxin damage when cold, but only if the patient
      is irradiated.
  - balance: Screwdriver (the drink) and Potassium Iodide are similar. They will heal
      toxin damage when the target is irradiated.
  - balance: Screwdriver, Potassium Iodide, and Pentetic Acid will halt the damaging
      effects of radiation, just like showers. This means no tox damage or burns.
  - balance: The gravity generator, instead of giving radiation when on, will now
      have a high gravity field around it.
  - balance: Radiation protection has been kept to engineering hardsuits, rad suits,
      and H.E.C.K. suits. This can be expanded to others, those are just the ones
      I recognized.
  - balance: Genetics no longer uses radiation, but instead genetic damage. Genetic
      damage works very similarly--once it tops 100%, you will start to take toxin
      damage. Gorillas are now made through genetic damage instead of radiation.
  - rscdel: Removed the halogen counter PDA app.
  - rscdel: Removed the emag effect on geiger counters, though an emag functionality
      can be added back later.
  - rscdel: Removed the geiger counter from cyborgs, but mostly because it's not actually
      really that useful anymore? Everything glows green!
  - rscdel: Removed the advanced wirebrush, a weird consumer of radiation with an
      extremely niche purpose. The standard wirebrush still exists.
  - rscdel: Removed radiation scanning from meson goggles.
  - rscdel: Removed leftover radiation collectors on ruins.
  - rscdel: Removed radiation from the radioisotope thermoelectric generator, though
      it still produces power. Trivia points if you actually know what that is!

      damage.
  - balance: Technetium 99 and Unstable Mutagen now deal toxin damage instead of radiation
      damage.
  - balance: Polonium will now irradiate the mob its in, and deal toxin damage if
      they're already irradiated (or can't be).
  - balance: Breathing tritium will now irradiate you after a certain amount, as well
      as deal toxin damage.
  - code_imp: vampire drain now uses the cooldown system
  - rscadd: 'There''s a new traitor flavor: The Champions of Evil'
  - bugfix: Shapeshifting into a Human while in a vent will once again gib you.
  - bugfix: Fixes catwalks being added on top of each other infinitely.
  jjpark-kb:
  - bugfix: fixes glassblowing and ceramics to work on the forge again
  tf-4:

      area.

  ATHATH:
  - bugfix: Liches (and mortals) can no longer use explosive lances to store grenade
      phylacteries inside of indestructible objects (including structures)), immortal
      mobs, or effects. As a side effect, you should no longer accidentally trigger
      your explosive lance on the wrong target by misclicking on a piece of graffiti
      during the heat of combat.

      do so successfully.
  - bugfix: Corpses will no longer scream when their limbs melt to the bone in icemoon's
      plasma lava
  - bugfix: fixed guns that are supposed to be undroppable (implant guns, guns when
      using an anti-drop implant) dropping anyway when you shoot yourself in the leg
      due to being Clumsy
  thestubborn:
  - bugfix: the victorian suits are in the loadout now
2021-11-06:
  ReinaCoder:
  - bugfix: Fixes the two Disco Elysium detectives suits to be non-adjustable
  SkyratBot:
  - balance: The wine cork fired when champagne is popped open is now a projectile
      and not a thrown item. It can ricochet on walls and will leave an harmless wine
      cork item when its trajectory has finished.
  - bugfix: This also fixes a small exploit with hand-thrown corks knocking people
      down, which was unintended.
  - server: Init profiles are now logged separately from standard ones, in init_profiler.json
  - bugfix: Fixed the curator PDA having some inconsistent-looking icons for slotted

      an atom's View Variables menu as well as when editing an existing color matrix.
  - rscadd: custom say emotes, or in other words, radio emotes. The format is for
      example "screams and shouts*damnit!" with any relevant radio keys, language
      keys and all that used as normal, for example, ";,o screams and shouts*damnit!"
      or you can use just the emote, ie, ";screams!*"
  - bugfix: Corpses will no longer cough, spit, or choke on blood when you hit them
      in the chest really hard
  SpaceVampire:
  - bugfix: Those who stand below the shoulders of giants, are now correctly unable
      to reach up to that glorious head above.

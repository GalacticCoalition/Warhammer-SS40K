2021-11-03:
  Guillaume Prata:
  - balance: Plasmamen belt tanks volume and the rate that their lungs consume plasma
      got lowered to 1/4 to stop the easy 2 hour long O2 inside a plasmamen belt tank
      trick. It doesn't change how long the internals last for plasmamen.
  Kryson:
  - balance: Regular medical syringe guns have been replaced with syringe rifles
  - imageadd: new dna/dart/medical Syringe gun sprite
  RatFromTheJungle:
  - bugfix: fixes the guard baton being deleted because you brought your wintercoat
      to work.
  Ryll/Shaps:
  - rscadd: Added shaking soda cans! Take an unopened soda can and right click it
      in hand to shake it all around, increasing its fizziness.
  - balance: Having an unopened soda can hucked at you will actually hurt quite a
      bit, around the level of a toolbox. This also has a chance of bursting the soda
      can on impact, leaving it useless as a weapon after.
  SkyratBot:
  - balance: brain washing now cures up to lobotomy tier traumas
  - rscadd: You can now disarm someone into an available open locker to close it on
      them as your disarming action.
  - rscadd: You can now disarm someone into an available closed locker to open the
      locker behind them up.
  - balance: The organic slurry is now retained inside the rat after it is dipped
      in welding fuel.

      readaptation can still be seen while scrolling.

      the wall in Icebox security

      ruins

      to prevent venting the
  - bugfix: The duplicate APC in Icebox maint has been tracked down and destroyed.
      Again.
  - balance: Obsessed have a low chance of stuttering and displaying shifty behavior
      near their targets, instead of vomiting or passing out if on good mood. This
      is to better allow verbal interactions between obsessed and obsession target,
      while keeping them shifty and creepy.
  - spellcheck: corrected the name of the peripherals control board being secured
      on the Savannah-Ivanov
  - balance: Radiation is now a status effect, where you are either irradiated or
      not. When irradiated, you will take constant toxin damage, and irregular burn
      damage. Radiation is removed once all toxin damage is healed. Standing under
      a shower will pause the harmful effects of radiation, making it easier to heal.
      Everything that is irradiated will glow green.
  - balance: A lot of radiation sources keep their radiating capabilities, though
      most of it was eyeballed. If anything was significantly nerfed/buffed, feel
      free to let me know.
  - rscdel: Removes contamination from radiation.
  - balance: Uranium structures will irradiate those around them, but will be delayed,
      giving you time to stay away.
  - rscdel: The radioactive microlaser no longer irradiates, but still has its knockdown,
      which was never related.
  - balance: Seiver now heals high toxin damage when cold, but only if the patient
      is irradiated.
  - balance: Screwdriver (the drink) and Potassium Iodide are similar. They will heal
      toxin damage when the target is irradiated.
  - balance: Screwdriver, Potassium Iodide, and Pentetic Acid will halt the damaging
      effects of radiation, just like showers. This means no tox damage or burns.
  - balance: The gravity generator, instead of giving radiation when on, will now
      have a high gravity field around it.
  - balance: Radiation protection has been kept to engineering hardsuits, rad suits,
      and H.E.C.K. suits. This can be expanded to others, those are just the ones
      I recognized.
  - balance: Genetics no longer uses radiation, but instead genetic damage. Genetic
      damage works very similarly--once it tops 100%, you will start to take toxin
      damage. Gorillas are now made through genetic damage instead of radiation.
  - rscdel: Removed the halogen counter PDA app.
  - rscdel: Removed the emag effect on geiger counters, though an emag functionality
      can be added back later.
  - rscdel: Removed the geiger counter from cyborgs, but mostly because it's not actually
      really that useful anymore? Everything glows green!
  - rscdel: Removed the advanced wirebrush, a weird consumer of radiation with an
      extremely niche purpose. The standard wirebrush still exists.
  - rscdel: Removed radiation scanning from meson goggles.
  - rscdel: Removed leftover radiation collectors on ruins.
  - rscdel: Removed radiation from the radioisotope thermoelectric generator, though
      it still produces power. Trivia points if you actually know what that is!
  - balance: The EMP'd advanced energy gun now deals burn damage instead of radiation
      damage.
  - balance: Technetium 99 and Unstable Mutagen now deal toxin damage instead of radiation
      damage.
  - balance: Polonium will now irradiate the mob its in, and deal toxin damage if
      they're already irradiated (or can't be).
  - balance: Breathing tritium will now irradiate you after a certain amount, as well
      as deal toxin damage.
  - code_imp: vampire drain now uses the cooldown system
  - rscadd: 'There''s a new traitor flavor: The Champions of Evil'
  - bugfix: Shapeshifting into a Human while in a vent will once again gib you.
  - bugfix: Fixes catwalks being added on top of each other infinitely.
  jjpark-kb:
  - bugfix: fixes glassblowing and ceramics to work on the forge again
  tf-4:
  - bugfix: Due to budget cuts, the NCV Titan no longer has seven APCs in the same
      area.

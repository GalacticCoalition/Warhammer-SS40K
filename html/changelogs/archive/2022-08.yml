      icon issues to @Orion_The_Fox#1915. (DOES NOT INCLUDE NRI)
  - qol: The Tactical/Tacticool Turtleneck overwrites have gotten re-done in a much
      cleaner way! Syndicate crew will find only they have access to the lovely red
      ones (Reskinnable with Alt-Click), and NT Crew's Tacti-cool Turtlenecks will
      always have sensors no matter if its blue or charcoal (Again, reskinnable).

      to facilitate improved performance on the DM side, the lua editor UI no longer

      enabled using a toggle-button to the right of the tabs.

  - balance: "After several interviews with space-station investors, Firefighters have been deemed \"unhelpful\" and \"redundant\"; as such, SolGov is proud to introduce their new 811 hotline for Breach Control! Our teams have been outfitted with the gear needed to stabilize your station's atmospherics, both leaks and contamination; they are not to be treated as a repair crew, but rather a life-saving atmospherics service! *911 calls will also automatically route your request while you get used to the new phone number.* Thank you, - SolGov Frontier Admin Division"

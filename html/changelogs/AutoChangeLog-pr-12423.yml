changes: 
  - rscadd: "Expanded heavily on action buttons"
  - rscadd: "Adds an action button dropdown that sits just under the normal list in the top left. You can drag new buttons onto it to insert them. Click on it to show its contents, do what you want to do, then click again anywhere to contract it. Alt click it to reset all button positions"
  - rscadd: "Action buttons will now remember their position between rounds. So if you really like your flashlight right next to your player for some reason, we support that now"
  - rscadd: "When you start to drag an action button, docking ports will appear in places that it can be inserted into. (Outside of just floating somewhere on your screen of course)"
  - rscdel: "Removed action button locking, and the associated preference. I'm reasonably sure literally none uses this, but if you do hit me up
qol: Dragging an action button will now give you an outline of its size around your cursor"
  - bugfix: "You can no longer cause the screen to expand by putting an action button on the edge of widescreen, and then resizing to standard."
  - refactor: "Refactors action and button code significantly. lots of little things."

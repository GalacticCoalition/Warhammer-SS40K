  - refactor: "Genital prefs have been refactored. As a result, redundant toggle prefs of these organs have been removed."
  - qol: "\"Uses Skin Tone\" pref has been split: each visible genital now has its own \"Skin Tone\" and \"Skin Color\" pref. This means that human-er characters can now have their bits roughly of the same color of their skin without having to guess it through the color input."

changes:
  - balance: "forged sword, katana, spear, axe, and hammer had their force lowered (so wielding multiplier can double)"
  - balance: "bokken had its force very slightly increased (so wielding multiplier can halve)"
  - bugfix: "you can no longer get infinite amounts of experience for hammering forged items (the hits required check is earlier and with a return)"
  - rscadd: "added perfect hits, which grant a great deal of smithing experience and can increase the damage of forged weapons (up to 3 additional force)"
  - rscadd: "added mindless killer component to all forged weapons-- deal twice the damage to any mob that has no mind (no mind means not player controller)"

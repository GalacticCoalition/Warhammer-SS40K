  - rscadd: "Nanite slurry OD will now heal synthetic organ damage, but raise core temperature and do brute (half the rate of healing) in exchange."
  - balance: "Nanite slurry twice as effective for healing, but OD has been reduced to 10u from 20u"
  - balance: "Remade the orderable nanite slurry pills bottles into critical system repair pills. Each pill will inflict a nanite slurry OD (30u), do ~ 75 brute, some burn, but heal ~ 240 organ damage."

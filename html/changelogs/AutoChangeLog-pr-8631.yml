  - balance: "SEVA suits no longer accept goliath plates, as was intended by the original PR author, and now add two seconds of stun to goliath grabs. Dont shoot the messenger."
  - bugfix: "A recent factory mixup in the core worlds made it so that SEVA suits were comming with plate hooks for enviromental suits. Centcom has corrected this, and as such SEVA suits are now back to their manufactuing spec."
  - code_imp: "Relocated SEVA from explorer subtype to its own, to avoid inheriting plate addition from the hooded/explorer/XYZ subtype."

  - rscadd: "A significantly smaller selection of new SolFed weapons has taken the place of the now missing Armadyne selection."
  - rscdel: "So basically, all of Armadyne is gone."
  - qol: "A large number of weapons now use singular interchangeable magazine types, rather than having seven different 9mm magazines to do the same thing"
  - balance: "Any weapon that was replaced is going to have different stats from what they used to be, numbers subject to change"
  - sound: "Several new firing sounds from TGMC for the new weapons"
  - image: "Whole collection of new ammo, gun, case, and so on sprites by myself"
  - image: "Gun case worn on the back sprites done by Zydras"
  - code_imp: "Where applicable, containers spawning gun stuff use generate_items_inside, which is much neater than spamming new x(src)"

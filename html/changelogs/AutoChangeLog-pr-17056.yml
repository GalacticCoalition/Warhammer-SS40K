changes: 
  - qol: "Forge baking now behaves like an oven would, the ability to put oven trays inside of the forge being how things are cooked now rather than just using a food item on the forge."
  - balance: "Forge upgrading has been changed to be entirely based upon one's forging skill, rather than the use of lavaland monster drops on the forge."
  - refactor: "Basically all of forge code has been refactored to some degree."

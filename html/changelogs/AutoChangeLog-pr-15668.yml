  - bugfix: "The DNR trait now works properly, and medical will find they cannot revive those with the DNR trait - rather, they should preserve the body and morgue it."
  - balance: "When you select the DNR verb as a ghost, your body will now gain the DNR trait, making medical properly unable to revive it. If this is an accident, as usual, ahelp it. (And stop pressing confirmation prompts that you disagree with!)"

  - code_imp: "Vastly improved the code of the Examine menu's Character Preview, making it a lot more reflective of what the character currently looks like, while also making it much more performant at the same time!"
  - bugfix: "Cyborgs will now appear in the Character Preview (without their lights, sadly) of the Examine panel too!"

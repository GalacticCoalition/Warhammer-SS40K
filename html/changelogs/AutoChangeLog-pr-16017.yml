  - balance: "MCR cells are now upgrades rather than hotswappable 'laser magazines' that must be empty of charge before insertion into a gun"
  - qol: "MCR cells have a function to discharge themselves in case you end up with a charged one needing to be inserted into a gun"
  - balance: "MCR scattershot lasers will now do 20 damage divided by the number of lasers, rather than 30 or 45 divided"
  - balance: "The MCR laser coloring attachment is no longer attainable through lathes"
  - balance: "The MCR cell self charging attachment is only attainable through micron control systems in cargo"
  - balance: "Micron control systems is now equivalent in max price to NT armories, and the price of the MCR itself has been lowered to be equivalent to an allstar SC-2 (a little over half the original price)"
  - bugfix: "MCR cells will now tell you the correct number of seconds until they malfunction"

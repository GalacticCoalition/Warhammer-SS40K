  - balance: "Security Medic adjustment. Replaced the latex gloves with nitrile. Replaced the advanced first aid kit with a brute one. Removed extraneous skeleton crew access, and surgical normal access. Removed compact defib. Removed surgical bag from locker. Made actual doctors at least plausibly valuable at round start."

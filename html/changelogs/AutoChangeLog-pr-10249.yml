  - bugfix: "The Explorer Gasmask now has a muzzle variant"
  - bugfix: "Various masks now show muzzles thru them, as they were meant to. Luchador momento."
  - bugfix: "Helmets will now properly hide masks beneath them, instead of causing sprite clipping."
  - code_imp: "Added the SHOWSPRITEEARS flag, to force ears to show over an item with HIDEHAIR. This will let sprites with earholes actually fit ears thru them, but not show the hair instead"

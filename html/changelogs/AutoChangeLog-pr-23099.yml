changes:
  - refactor: "Refactored the player ranks system to separate the legacy file-based system from a new SQL-based system, allowing the various systems to be interacted with far easier outside of the game."
  - refactor: "Player ranks are now working off of a subsystem, rather than being completely disjointed, making it easier to interface with. If you're having issues with your Donator status, simply reconnect and that should fix it!"
  - config: "Added three separate configs for forcing the usage of the legacy Donator, Mentor and Veteran systems, defaulting to on (so this should hopefully not change anything on servers that have not done any migration yet)."

  - bugfix: "After lots of stress and confusion, Lopland and Armadyne are proud to announce that they've finally sorted out how to make helmets with both a visor and a flashlight function properly. Security will be given these new models that are much less... janky. Lopland has also taken the opportunity to update the helmets in general, including properly fitting them for muzzled crew, lengthening the forehead plating as to not make the wearer appear bald any more, and rounding out the very edges of the bulletproof helmet."

  - rscadd: "A new recipe for anointing bloodresin is now available exclusively for Primitive Demihumans, made from 80u liquid gibs and 20u of blood. Bloodresin invokes traditional rites of the Hearth to give names to worthy creatures. Using this in poor ways may displease the Gods. Woe upon your lineage."
  - rscadd: "A single pack of glowshroom mycelium has been added to the Hearth's starting seed stores for the benefit of creative healers, shamans, and radiation enthusiasts."

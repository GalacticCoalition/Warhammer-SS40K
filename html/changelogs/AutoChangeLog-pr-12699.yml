  - bugfix: "Fixed Hemophages being selectable by non-Veteran. If you were a non-Veteran and had a Hemophage, it'll convert them to a human when you spawn in, but I'd still recommend making the change to human yourself, just in case something funky happens. The alternative to that is to become a Veteran if you want to keep your Hemophage :)"

changes:
  - balance: "Space Dragon can no longer choose its rift locations freely, and instead is given 5 pre-determined locations to pick from instead"
  - balance: "Space Dragon itself has been buffed in order to support a more confrontational playstyle, however its wing gust now requires a line of sight to targets in order to affect them."
  - balance: "Player Space Carp from rifts now have buffed health, but reduced object damage values. They also gain a temporary speed boost when hit by Space Dragon's fire breath instead of taking damage."
  - balance: "Carp rift spawn times have been reduced, the healing AOE is now a 3x3 instead of a 1x1, and apply normal gravity in a large radius around them"
  - balance: "Space Dragon and rift carps now communicate on a private mind link channel via action button similar to Raw Prophets and Slimepeople."
  - bugfix: "Fixed Gravity Generator forced gravity not applying."
  - bugfix: "Intern Announcer will no longer replace Space Dragon announcements."
  - qol: "The roundend report for space dragons now collates all players who played a carp into one entry, rather than one per carp spawned."
  - qol: "Space Dragon sounds are much less ear piercingly loud."

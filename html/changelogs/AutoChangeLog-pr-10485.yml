  - bugfix: "Cut half of the overlays that would currently be applied to computers due to connecting computer, reducing their impact on performance in that regard, hopefully."
  - imageadd: "Fixed the sprite for the arrival shuttle recall terminal so it isn't fullbright all the time and gave it a neat little animation."

  - bugfix: "The razors will now properly direct you towards the right areas to aim for instead of letting you maim the person you're trying to shave, unless you have combat mode turned on. At that point, maim away."
  - spellcheck: "Fixed the name of a few of the barber's tools."
  - code_imp: "Both hair dyes are now merged together in one, super powerful hair dye spray!"

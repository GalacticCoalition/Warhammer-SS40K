changes:
  - rscadd: "Towels! Wear them on your chest, your waist or your head, use them to dry up those that are wet or to dry up liquid puddles."
  - rscadd: "You can wash towels in sinks, or wring them, to remove the reagents from them, but the best way to have clean towels will always be a washing machine! Wringing towels leaves a mess behind, unless you do it in a bucket, which will make it transfer a portion of the liquids into it, losing some on the way."
  - bugfix: "Fixed ears being displayed at all times if you're wearing something on your head, but not on your mask slot."
  - bugfix: "Fixed the mood buff for when you wash clothes."
  - code_imp: "Improved some of the code related to interactions between mops/reagent_containers and liquid turfs, hopefully fixing some bugs on the way too!"

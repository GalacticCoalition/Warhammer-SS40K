  - qol: "When ordering multiple items with a personal account or with a department budget, all of those items will arrive in the same container, case or crate depending on the number of items."
  - balance: "Company imports companies no longer need to be purchased"
  - balance: "Company interest no longer exists at all"
  - balance: "Company import items cannot run out of stock anymore"
  - balance: "Company import items are overall significantly cheaper than they used to be"
  - balance: "Some items in company imports have either been added, removed, or tweaked in nearly all companies due to not quite fitting anymore, or missing where I felt they should have been. Most of the removed items are comically easy to attain or otherwise useless and were only there to raise interest before, but now that interest is gone they are not necessary."
  - bugfix: "Cyborgs can use company imports to order things off of the cargo budget now"
  - image: "Added a new wooden box sprite for import items that come from the cargo budget, to prevent infinite money generation at the same time"

  - code_imp: "The confusion status effect is now based on duration (seconds) instead of magic numbers. Fun fact: When confusion was refactored 2 years ago, literally all confusion effects had their durations halved. Pretty neat!"
  - code_imp: "Confusion also applies its effects via signal. Moved it out of move code."
  - code_imp: "Flashing code is now slightly better."

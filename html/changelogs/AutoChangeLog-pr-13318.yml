changes: 
  - refactor: "Refactored how snouts worked, ensuring that they are linked to an actual external organ now, which allows for much more dynamic management of snouted variants of articles of clothing."
  - bugfix: "Lizards, mammals and synthetics are no longer forced to use snouted sprites for headgear 24/7, and will now only use them when necessary."
  - code_imp: "Improved slightly the code for MODsuit module snout detection, making it slightly better."

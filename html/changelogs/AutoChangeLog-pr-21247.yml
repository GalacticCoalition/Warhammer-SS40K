  - rscadd: "When you are drunk, the strength of your slurring now varies based on how drunk you are. Being \"a little drunk\" only rarely slurs your words, being average drunk is the same as the old effect, while being very drunk now slurs your words even more."
  - rscadd: "Some non-alcohol sources of slurring, such as concussions, now give \"generic slurring\" rather than \"drunk slurring\", which less resemble being drunk (ie, no burping)."
  - rscadd: "Mind restoration now heals ALL slurring, rather than only drunk slurring (which includes cult / heretic slurring)."

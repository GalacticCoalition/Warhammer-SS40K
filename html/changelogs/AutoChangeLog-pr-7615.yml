  - bugfix: "Nanotrasen realized that not being able to preview color changes that were to be applied to the items they were hoping to sell in their vendors has drastically reduced interest in those items. They hope to bring back interest on them by enabling the preview once again."
  - code_imp: "icon2html now supports an override to use it even if it's meant to be disabled on here."

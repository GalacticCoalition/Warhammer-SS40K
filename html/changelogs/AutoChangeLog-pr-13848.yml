changes: 
  - refactor: "Refactored taur body extensions into an external organ, to make its code slightly less cursed."
  - bugfix: "Not all taur body extensions show shoes anymore, as intended."
  - bugfix: "Taurs no longer will display legs that they should not be displaying underneath their body extension, and will instead have invisible, non-removable legs there instead, to avoid any balance concern."

changes:
  - balance: "The CIN military surplus crate's item table and corresponding weights have been changed, the RC Makarov, pp-95, associated ammo for both of those, and the crucifix can no longer spawn. Bolt action rifles mimic what they do on tg, where they come in a case with a 20/80 percent chance to spawn either a good, normal rifle/a rifle that can jam on occasion. All items in the crate now have an equal chance of spawning when picked from, aside from the gun cases which spawn at a slightly higher rate than everything else does."
  - image: "The Quartermaster's Archangel rifle has been given a new sprite and identity to match the other boltactions that its based on"
  - image: "AP and rubber .310 bullet casings now have a small colored bit at the bottom to show that they are different from the normal all red bullets"
  - spellcheck: ".310 ammo in the autolathe now has its (Lethality Warning) attached to the end of the name like it should"

  - bugfix: "The Arrivals Midpoint is now a bit more vague on the method of your arrival! Did you teleport from far away? Dock your own ship maybe? I dunno, but the hallway beside the tram opens up RP options! It also has other fixes such as Dorms Bolts, and light improvements, like a proper truckstop bathroom and a small cafe sponsored by Jim Norton's Quebecois Coffee!"

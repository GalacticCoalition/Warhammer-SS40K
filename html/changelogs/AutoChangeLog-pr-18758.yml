  - refactor: "changed battered sausage recipe so that you batter the sausage before grilling it & cleaned formatting within modular food files"
  - imageadd: "added a sprite for the cooked version of the battered sausage"
  - code_imp: "added extra nutriment to cooked battered sausage to represent the battered version being slightly more filling than plain old sausages"
  - code_imp: "made beer batter reagent weakly alchoholic, it's 1/3 as alchoholic as the beer it contains. so if you have nothing else...you can get drunk off it now I guess."

## Title: Job Access Overrides

MODULE ID: JOB_ACCESS_OVERRIDES

### Description:

Job access overrides.

Create one file per job, and document any access changes via comments to prevent having to code dive to find the original accesses.

### TG Edits:

- Replaces `minimal_access` and `extra_access` on various job datums.

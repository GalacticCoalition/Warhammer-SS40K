These RSDs were designed with the Medical field in mind, a tool meant to offer comfort to the temporarily-departed while their bodies are being repaired, healed, or produced. The Evoker is essentially a very specialized handheld NIF, still using the same nanomachinery for the software and hardware. This careful instrument is able to host a virtual space for a great number of Engrams for an essentially indefinite amount of time in an unlimited variety of simulations, even able to transfer them to and from a NIF. However, it's best Medical practice to not lollygag."

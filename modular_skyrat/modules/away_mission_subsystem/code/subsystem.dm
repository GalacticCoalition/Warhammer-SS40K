/**  SSaway_missions
* This SS is a bit of a strange one. It will go mostly unused except when certain away missions are initialized.
* The SS works by hooking into a `/datum/away_controller` subtype, which is based on the name of the away mission.
* For example, the away mission "Outbomb Cuban Pete" would require the controller's path to be `/datum/away_controller/outbomb_cuban_pete`.
* The subsystem itself shouldn't be used for much but to simply pass on to the away controller, because the SS is genericized for all away missions.

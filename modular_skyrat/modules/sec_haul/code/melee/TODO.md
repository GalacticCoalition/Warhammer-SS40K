1. On baton loc change to non-top-level storage of mob: After x amount of time, check location, and if not on top-level storage, disable overcharge
* Negates the issue of hording entirely by making storage of overcharged batons impossible
* Also allows for throwing batons because of the delay
* Good solution?
* DISABLES THE ABILITY TO PUT BATONS IN YOUR BACKPACK AFTER YOU HIT AND WAIT FOR COOLDOWN!

2. Disable attacking during charge-up, make chargeup more impactful

3. Add some objective downside to overcharge?

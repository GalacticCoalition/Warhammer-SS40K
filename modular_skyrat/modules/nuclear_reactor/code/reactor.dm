 * 2. The reactor has reached maximum pressure and is going to explode. This causes the reactor to blowout.
 * A blowout is far more catastrophic than a meltdown, and will cause the most damage to the station. When a reactor blowsout, it will violently explode in
 * a very large fireball, leaving the station in a state of chaos as radioactive gasses and toxic gasses are released in all directions, landing all across the station.

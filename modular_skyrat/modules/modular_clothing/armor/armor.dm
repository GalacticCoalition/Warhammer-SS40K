/*Let me just put a big fucking note right here because I know somebody is going to complain about this:
No, this does not let you stack the helmet-given flash resistance and Nightvision or Thermal glasses with no consequence.
Sure, you can do it 100%, but it will invalidate the helmet-given flash protection and render you vulnerable
just as if you were wearing them separate. Stop screaming to me about this. Please.*/

		designs, there are flaws and no single one is perfect, but they achieve a singular goal and that is the \
		important part. Suits such as these are made specifically for the rare emergency that creates a hazard \
		environment that other equipment just can't quite handle. Often, these suits are able to protect their users \
		from not only electricity, but also radiation, biological hazards, other people, so on. This suit will not, \

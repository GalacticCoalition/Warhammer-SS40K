	desc = "This 'tongue' isn't really a spoken language at all, but instead an information-dense and complicated series of stacatto rattles, first constructed by some of the earliest plasmamen to communicate privately in the face of wider discrimination.\
		While nearly impossible to learn 'naturally' for fleshier species, many of the 'vocalizations' can be approximated with tongue or mandible-clicks, though this is typically considered offensive.\
		Differences in dialect primarily consist of 'suited' and 'suitless' versions-the more muffled rattling from inside of a plasmaman's suit being considered 'formal', and suitless, loud rattling being considered informal at best."

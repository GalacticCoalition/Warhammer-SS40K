	You are from one of the myriad space stations, orbital platforms, long haul freighters, \

	Spacers near the core worlds of an item are typically accustomed to life in the fast lane, constantly moving between \
	places, meeting a myriad of people and experiencing many of the cultures in your empire. \
	As such, Spacers of the core systems tend to be busy, sociable and mobile, rarely satisfied with settled life. \
	They almost universally know how to live and work in the void and take to such jobs more readily than their planet-bound counterparts."

	Raised on one of the long haul freighters that move between frontier worlds delivering vital goods, \
	a lonely outpost on the edge of a dreary backwater, such people are raised in small, confined environments with few others, \
	and tend to be most familiar with older, reliable but outdated technology. \
	An independent sort, people on the frontier are more likely to be isolationist and self-driven."

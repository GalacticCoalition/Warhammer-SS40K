	description = "Kingston is an occupied ocean world made of various archipelagos, within the Lordania system. The planet's surface is 90% water, and much of the population live around the equator. \
	The planet is a humid subtropical world, and a huge tourist destination for Sol citizens.  Kingston is extremely multicultural, and many old human cultures still hold an enclave. It also contains a large \
	number of Tritonians, both as tourists and residents. An estimated 15 million tourists visit annually.  While a highway and magnetic train system link many of the islands, boats are incredibly popular amongst \
	tourists and workers alike. Many of the islands on the planet have been created via tectonic plates or volcanic eruption, making the planet more geologically active than Earth. \
	Despite this, technology of the 26th century has developed enough to mitigate most structural damage done in the event of earthquakes or tsunamis. \
	Formally the United Nations of Kingston, the planet is made up of multiple island nations and several planetary representatives.<br><br>The people of Kingston are relatively unassuming. They have much in common with \
	their Sol brothers, and are usually seen onboard most SolFed Vessels.  Growing up on a waterworld, most Kingstonians can sail a boat, something rare in the 26th Century.  \
	Typically dark in skin due to the planet's proximity to it's sun, Kingstonians come in various forms."

	distance = "40 light years"
	description = "Lordania is a heavily developed plains world in the Lordania system.  The planet has developed five large mega-cities, connected by various suburban developments. \
	Heavy use of dams and nature reserves have allowed the people to terraform parts of the planet.  Historically, the planet has had a large wealth gap, \
	which recent years have only made worse.  The planet's economy has been rebuilt from the ground up around entertainment and the arts. The New Ares Metroplex is the entertainment, \
	and fashion capital of the outer rim of the SolFed.  Numerous TSCs bought up parts of the planet during the economic depression, and now fully exploit the success.  It is not a city planet, but \
	it could become one in the next 300 years. The planet enjoys warm relations with its neighbor Kingston. Lordania can be described as an aristocratic republic, and have historical \
	ties with the political families of Luna. <br><br>  The people of Lordania are divided into two parts, Upper and Lower Lordanians.  Upper Lordanians are wealthy, and are \
	typically only seen on the planet, or in entertainment medias. Lower Lordanians are more common, and many opt leave their home planet. Historically, Lordanians have a superiority complex, \
	and often see themselves as better. Most Lordanians are seen as untrustworthy, or selfish. As such, they are rarely seen within Sol's Defence Forces."

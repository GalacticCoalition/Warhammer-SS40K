	Established during the early days of imperial colonisation and named after the colonists' capital ship, it soon became a cultural and economical centre of the whole empire. Or rather, the more inhabitable and stabilised regions.\
	Much of the planet has been heavily scarred by the early days of the colonisation, leaving certain areas of the planet heavily polluted or practically uninhabitable, which became the main focus of the Geological and Ecological Collegium's efforts. \
	In an effort to keep people from immigrating from the planet, the empire has been heavily subsidizing various ecological and charity NGOs to help counteract the disaster.\
	This state of affairs has seen the immigration of many imperial citizens to the SolFed in recent years, hoping to escape the poor conditions they found themselves in.\
	The more stable regions near the approximated location of the first landings, now becoming the New St. Petersburg, however, have become thriving with life and various cultural points of interests, as lots of tourists come here to become familiar with the imperial history.\
	Despite everything unfortunate that have happened to the people of Providence, they remain proud and unbroken, heavily patriotic and tend to bring this with them wherever they go."

	description = "Gagarin is a scientific colony located in the Potemkin-Tauric system close to the anomalous Sector 13. \
	Given an explicit approval of both the Innovations Collegia and the Eternal Empress, it acquired a unique status of an independent people-owned research institute. \
	Ruled by a court of well-known scientists and researchers, known as the Academic Senate, Gagarin's recent history is a wave of peaceful protests-gone-wrong. \
	In an attempt to keep science away from any political influence and attempts to militarise it, a huge group of scientists, academics and workers, led by the \
	professor of xenobiological sciences Vladislav Shatynbai, formed an undercover organisation formally known as the <b>Astro Orientalis</b>, which soon became a turning point in the colony's life. \
	Wave after wave of various political activism, it spread through the people's minds, as their ideas became more widespread and agreeable by most of the population, with more people joining this organisation, until it reached its climax. \
	An all-colonial peaceful protest, led by the Shatynbai, happened, gathering a massive collection of people of all sorts, and making their way through the colony's main square. \
	Such an act didn't go unnoticed, and, being afraid of a possible riot, the local police department's chief of police had assembled a sizeable amount of people to disrupt the gathering. Resulting in a massacre. \
	Lots of scientists got killed during this march, with Vladislav suffering a grave wound and soon after dying in a hospital, after giving an interview to an independent news reporter, who made this event well-known across the empire and an important topic to talk about. \
	This event has got interest of the Empress herself, who, after a personal visit of the people on the planet and listening to their demands, gave them a permission to become an independent organ protected by the Imperiya, \
	as long as they would be assisting them with their research. This event has marked the creation of an Academic Senate and the formation of the Gagarin colony as it's currently known.\
	People of Gagarin are very independent and strong-willed, commonly acting in the opposition to the known methodics in order to discover something new."

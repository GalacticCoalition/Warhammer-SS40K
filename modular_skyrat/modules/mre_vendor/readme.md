## Title: MRE Vendor

MODULE ID: mre_vendor

### Description:

This PR is a sort of soft rework for the chef job, moving its design philosophy closer to that of the bartender, where visiting is optional, and the lack of a chef is not a terrible station ending threat - it adds a vendor with MREs containing full meals, available to all crew in or near the bar of each map. There's lots of variety, and meals for each major race, as well as common dietary restrictions, and a contraband meal available by hacking.

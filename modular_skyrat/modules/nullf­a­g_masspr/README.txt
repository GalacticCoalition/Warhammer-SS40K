NullF­a­g here
i'm just gonna say outright, this method of modularisation is an extremely a­u­t­i­s­t­i­c and r­e­t­a­r­d­e­d one, and i'm only obliging
by it because *a particular maintainer* would lose their non-existent mind otherwise
instead of having our code in one proper place it's scattered across, at the time of writing this, 986 f­u­c­k­i­n­g folders
that's not including the few sane souls that put their code in Skyrat-tg\modular_skyrat\master_files because they understand
that tracking down "who fucked up security_level.dm" or whatever the f­u­c­k later on will be an absolute pain

anyway
emote_blacklist.txt works on the basis of "put the emote key in a seperate line to have that blacklisted"
any remotely smart cookie can figure out what an emote key is, i'm not gonna explain it here

that is all
as a sidenote, don't screech at me for "putting bad words" in here
the text file is formatted in such a way that the github's r­e­t­a­r­d­e­d filter has no right of picking it up

(this readme looks much better in code editor, i swear)

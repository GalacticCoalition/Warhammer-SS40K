		## Incentives Guide

		Greetings, representative.
		This briefcase of "incentives" isn't here for your benefit.
		If you feel there is valuable information or objects
		to be gained for the Armadyne Corporation, you are
		authorized to spend the contents as you see fit to further that goal.
		If you require more funding, collecting via offering the catalog app's wares
		to the crew is recommended.

		To repeat, you are not to use the contents for your exclusive benefit,
		it must be used for Corporation purposes. Misuse of these will lead to
		internal investigation.
		Go forth, representative, and make the Corporation proud.

		Signed,
		Corporate Outreach Director James Walker

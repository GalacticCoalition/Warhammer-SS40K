	name = "Ousted Coreworld Akulan Aristocrat"
	description = "You were raised as a traditional Akulan aristocrat on their homeworld of Azulea or one of their many coreworlds in the Kingdom of Agurkrral. \
	You are simultaneously pampered and also rigidly disciplined with a military-styled education that would be comparable to aristocrats born in the ancient human Kingdom of Prussia. \
	You value intellectualism but not of the idle variety, as you thirst for discipline, strength, and brutality. \
	You live for no one, but the king and the collective will of the nation, and you have either served or sought to serve the state as a mid-level state official or military officer. \
	For some reason, despite your inherent superiority, you have ended up in this godforsaken piece of the universe. \
	Most likely, you were a traitor in the great Agurkrral-Taj War where you temporarily betrayed your nation in the hopes that you could save it. \
	You will have to make do for now in this temporary pitstop. \
	Note: You most likely prefer to be called an Azulean, not the foreign name of \"Akulan\" given to you."

	Unlike the coreworld aristocrats, power struggles are common, and education comes in the form of experience, not books or philosophy. \
	Your ancestors earned their place through iron and blood, raiding trading ships, outposts, and colonies as official privateers of your great kingdom. \
	Yet, despite your cunning and usefulness, you have ended up in this godforsaken piece of the universe. \
	You will make your mark one way or another."
